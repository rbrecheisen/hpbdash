DESIGN
======

What I have so far is a mechanism to execute arbitrary SQL queries. 
In the end I need to a have set of such queries that together provide
all the information needed by the surgeons. What each query has in 
common is the time period. Since you don't want to specify the time
period for each individual query, we can create a form that allows the
user to specify a start and end date easily.

Each query in the list, or report, will then be executed with this 
time period.
